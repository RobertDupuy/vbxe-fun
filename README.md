Atari VBXE card

From AtariAge thread on VBXE Tutorial in BASIC

Set your emulator to NTSC, VBXE, and Altirra BASIC and Altirra OS

Yes, it has all those requirements.   The final game probably won't, but this was partially written as a tutorial, and I wanted to use non-compiled basic, for ease of examining code.
